This is a simple tool that aims to help people building messages more visually in bulk in their RPG Maker projects. 
I know more recent versions already have plenty of functionalitites that help into that, but that are not
always the case. 

## What is and what is not supported?
- More known versions of RPG Maker (2000 to MZ).
- Just standard configurations, not fancy scripts/plugins support. 

## Try it out!
Sure! [Go ahead!](https://elsemieni.net/rpgmaker/msgtool/)

## I want to modify/add stuff.
Sure, why not? The license allows you to do that! :D
